## Premise

We can create an image by using a function that maps the (x, y) coordinates of the pixel to an (r, g, b) value. If we use the function `f(x, y) -> (x, x, x)` we get a greyscale image:

![greyscale](images/greyscale.png)

What if we could generate the functiion `f` randomly, then evaluate it on the (x, y) input !?

In the context of security, we can use for example an SSH key hash as the seed for RNG before generating the function, in effect, visualising the hash. 

## Some of my favourite images

These were generated by letting the grammar generate a function to a certain depth.

| Depth3 | Depth 6 | Depth 1 |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ![1](images/31.png) | ![2](images/61.png) | ![3](images/11.png) |
| ![1](images/32.png) | ![2](images/62.png) | ![3](images/12.png) |
| ![1](images/33.png) | ![2](images/63.png) | ![3](images/13.png) |

Going to a higher depth increases the odds of generating a more complex function. The logo was generated with depth = 10, using an AST with 1264 nodes! 

All the images so far use this grammar given in the paper:
